Word Unscrambler

For our project, we will be creating a game that allows users to unscramble six letter words.
The goal of the game is to unscramble all possible words made from the six letter word. Players
will have 2 minutes to unscramble all of the words or 2:30 to unscramble words when there are
more than 20 of them. The user advances on to the next round if they have unscrambled at least
one of the six letter words. If not, it's game over. A score will be kept after each round so
the more words a user unscrambles, the higher their score. The game is over when the player
cannot unscramble a 6 letter word in the time, or the player decides to quit.
